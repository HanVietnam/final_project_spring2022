# final_project_spring2022
 
My final project is looking at the City of Columbia for the last decade (2011 - 2020) to see how it has changed over the years. 

My data sources are: Census's ACS5 data for population, income, employment, education in the 2011 - 2020 period; data from IHGIS (https://ihgis.ipums.org/) for 1970 - 2010 period, and data from the FBI (https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend) for crime rate.

The project using Kyle Walker's tidycensus package (https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) (https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) and his book (https://walker-data.com/census-r/) as guidances.

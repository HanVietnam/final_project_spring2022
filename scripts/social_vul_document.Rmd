According to the CDC, Social vulnerability refers to the "resilience of
communities when confronted by external stresses on human health,
stresses such as natural or human-caused disasters, or disease
outbreaks." These methods implement an index similar to the one
maintained by the CDC which are adapted from methods published by
Flanagan et al. (2011) in "A Social Vulnerability Index for Disaster
Management," which describes 13 metrics for assessing the 'social
vulnerability' or 'adaptive capacity' (Davies et al. 2018) of a census
tract. This study attempts to replicate these metrics as closely as
possible at a block group scale using 5 year ACS data in order to
quantify the capacity of a block-group to respond to a given
disturbance, minimizing risks to health, safety, property and other
essential services. This index could be used to identify areas and
communities at an increased risk and target appropriate response,
recovery and mitigation efforts.

The SVI/ACI is **just one** component of a vulnerability assessment
which would include assessing the impact of the hazard itself (disease,
fire, flood hurricane, etc.), the vulnerability of the physical
infrastructure, and community assets/resources that could diminish the
impact of a given hazard and/or aid in recovery efforts in a given
community (Flanagan et al. 2011).

The index comprises 4 domains including:

> **Socioeconomic Status**
>
> -   Percent of Persons Below Poverty Level
>
> -   Percent of Persons (age 16+) Unemployed
>
> -   Per Capita Income

> **Language & Education**
>
> -   Percent of Persons With No 12th Grade Education
>
> -   Percent of Persons Do Not Who Speak English

> **Demographics**
>
> -   Percent of Persons 65 Years of Age or Older
>
> -   Percent of Persons 17 Years of Age or Younger
>
> -   Percent of Persons 5 Years of Age or Older With a Disability
>
> -   Percent of Single Parent Households

> **Housing & Transportation**
>
> -   Percent of Persons Living in Multi-Unit Structure
>
> -   Percent of Persons Living in a Mobile Home
>
> -   Percent of Persons Living in 'Crowded' Conditions (more than one
>     person per room)
>
> -   Percent of Household With No Vehicle Available
>
> -   Percent of Persons Residing in Group Quarters

    # B03002_003 - Estimate!!Total (WHITE ALONE, NOT HISPANIC OR LATINO)

> **Notes:** I used the B03002 table here because "Hispanic/Latino" is
> not considered a "race" by the U.S. Census Bureau, people of Hispanic
> or Latino origin either don't answer this question or they
> select/write-in any number of racial categories and which one they
> select can vary by geography and other demographic factors. According
> to the Pew Research Center, "In the 2010 census, 37% of Hispanics -
> 18.5 million people - said they belonged to "some other race." Among
> those who answered the race question this way in the 2010 census,
> 96.8% were Hispanic. And among those Hispanics who did, 44.3%
> indicated on the form that Mexican, Mexican American or Mexico was
> their race, 22.7% wrote in Hispanic or Hispano or Hispana, and 10%
> wrote in Latin American or Latino or Latin." The Census Bureau
> suggests that if you want to treat "Hispanic" as a "race-like"
> category, you use the B03002 table. So if you were to use the B02001

### **Optional Variables (Not Used in SVI)**

#### **Percent of Homes Occupied**

    # B25003_001 - Estimate!!Total B25003_003 - Estimate!!Total!!Renter occupied

> **Notes:** According to Lee et al. 2019, "Previous studies have shown
> that renters lack resources prior to a disaster (preparedness) and
> continue to do so in post disaster times (recovery). Before a
> disaster, available resources differ, including available funds and
> housing condition and location. Renters have limited household,
> social, and physical resources prior to a disaster, as compared to
> those of owners. Additionally, renters tend to suffer more severe
> damage during a disaster. During recovery, renters limited financial
> resources (i.e., lack of insurance and less governmental assistance;
> Bolin and Stanford 1998; Comerio 1998), as well as inadequate social
> and political capital, mean that they have less influence on decisions
> being made about recovery (Morrow 1999). This causes them to face
> greater struggles over a longer period of time." (Lee et al. 2019)

#### **Median Gross Rent as a Percentage of Income**

      B25071_001

    # B25071_001 - Estimate!!Median gross rent as a percentage of household income

> **Notes:** According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
> Development (HUD) "Families who pay more than 30 percent of their
> income for housing are considered cost burdened and may have
> difficulty affording necessities such as food, clothing,
> transportation and medical care." They may be above poverty level, but
> the cost of housing may still be a factor that effects their
> vulnerability and ability to recover from a crisis (HUD). According to
> Diaz et al., "Renting, crowding, and unaffordable housing are directly
> and indirectly linked with negative outcomes for children and adults
> (e.g., Evans, Lepore, Shejwal, & Palsane, 1998; Haurin, Parcel, &
> Haurin, 2002; Leventhal & Newman, 2010; Pollack, GriffÄ±n, & Lynch,
> 2010). These housing situations, coupled with other vulnerabilities,
> also increase exposure to harm and limit the ability of individuals
> and households to cope with and recover from the impacts of
> environmental hazards (...) For many households, spending more on
> housing costs than is standard suggests housing situations that are
> unstable, difficult to maintain over the long term, and may reflect
> stresses that are otherwise difficult to detect" (excerpt from Diaz et
> al. 2017).

> Experimental research confirms that the elderly and disabled confront
> unique difficulties during periods of evacuation." (Donner et al.
> 2008). For example: "Half of the deaths from Hurricane Katrina were
> adults age 75 and older (Brunkard, Namulanda, and Ratard, 2008), and
> 63 percent of the deaths after the 1995 heat wave in Chicago were
> adults age 65 or older (Whitman et al. 1997)" ... A 2012 survey found

> help from someone outside the household (National Association of Area
> Agencies on Aging, National Council on Aging, and UnitedHealthcare,
> 2012) (Shih et al. 2018)". According to Chau et al. "Living alone

> **Notes:** According to Flanagan et al. this should be an estimate of
> Percent male or female householder, no spouse present, with children
> under 18. There may be a variety of approximations available,
> including, but not limited to B23008; however, these tables fails to
> represent a variety of housing situations in which a child may be
> under the guardianship of a single adult caretaker and may also
> include situations in which a household is classified as a single
> parent household where there is the presence of an unmarried partner
> who is likely to provide support in the responsibilities of parenting,
> diminishing the unique risk faced by a single parent in a disaster
> scenario. According the Census Bureau, "A nonfamily householder" is a
> "householder living alone or with non-relatives only." A family is a
> group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related
> by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together so If there is
> 1.) No "unmarried partner of householder present" and 2.) It is a
> nonfamily household so the absence of a married partner is assumed and
> 3.) There is a child present then I assumed it would include children
> living with unmarried non-relatives where there is no unmarried
> partner present so although the child is unrelated to their adult

> **Notes:** "Demographic data shows that single mothers tend to be less

> poor and minority women experienced significant difficulties in

> reportedly set up only with small, nuclear households in mind.
> Moreover, Morrow and Enarson argue that women were victims of
> exploitation and fraud during the recovery period. In another study,
> Donner (2003) shows that census tracts in the United States with
> larger percentages of single mothers are more likely to experience a
> tornado death and/or injury. Rodriguez and Russell (2006) also report
> that women and children were disproportionately affected by the 2004
> Indian Ocean Tsunami and were more likely to be victims (e.g.,
> fatalities) of this catastrophic event relative to their male
